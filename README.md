This is a starting kit for the Inria Aerial Image Labeling challenge. 
We use the INRIA satelite dataset from [link](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/). The data set contains 180 of high resolution satelite images of 5 towns, each having 36 images. For every image, there is a reference image. In a reference image, the tiles are single-channel images with values 255 for the building class and 0 for the not building class.

Prerequisites:
Install Anaconda Python 3.6.6 

Usage:

(1) If you are a challenge participant:

- The file README.ipynb contains step-by-step instructions on how to create a sample submission for the Inria Aerial Image Labeling challenge. 
At the prompt type:
jupyter-notebook README.ipynb

- modify sample_code_submission to provide a better model

- zip the contents of sample_code_submission (without the directory, but with metadata), or

- download the public_data and run (double check you are running the correct version of python):

  `python ingestion_program/ingestion.py public_data sample_result_submission ingestion_program sample_code_submission`

then zip the contents of sample_result_submission (without the directory).

(2) If you are a challenge organizer and use this starting kit as a template, ensure that:

- you modify README.ipynb to provide a good introduction to the problem and good data visualization

- sample_data is a small data subset carved out the challenge TRAINING data, for practice purposes only (do not compromise real validation or test data)

- the following programs run properly:

    `python ingestion_program/ingestion.py sample_data sample_result_submission ingestion_program sample_code_submission`

    `python scoring_program/score.py sample_data sample_result_submission scoring_output`

- the metric identified by metric.txt in the utilities directory is the metric used both to compute performances in README.ipynb and for the challenge.
